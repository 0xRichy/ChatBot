Given the assumptions, we will be using Python with the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and sklearn for basic natural language processing and machine learning respectively. The chatbot will be a console-based application for simplicity.

Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `ChatBot`: This is the main class that will handle the chatbot functionality.
    - `__init__`: Initializes the chatbot with a training set of data.
    - `train`: Trains the chatbot using the training data.
    - `chat`: Starts a chat session, allowing the user to input text and receive responses from the chatbot.

2. `preprocess`: This function will preprocess the input text, making it ready for the chatbot to analyze.

3. `tokenize`: This function will tokenize the input text, breaking it down into individual words.

4. `bag_of_words`: This function will convert the tokenized words into a bag of words, which is a representation that the machine learning model can understand.

5. `predict_class`: This function will predict the class (or category) of the input text based on the trained model.

6. `get_response`: This function will generate a response based on the predicted class.

Now, let's start with the entry point file, `main.py`.
